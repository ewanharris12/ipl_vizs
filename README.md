## Project purpose ##
As part of a group project with two friends, we set up [Valuing T20](https://twitter.com/ValuingT20): our own cricket analysis group specialising in T20 cricket. We have followed cricket extensively and wanted to bring more understanding and context to the statistics used to analyse it. While this work is available on the linked twitte profile, this repo serves as a showcase of the code behind the scenes.

## Why did I get involved? ##
First and foremost I am a huge cricket fan. To be able to develop my data skills using data which really interests me was a no brainer. The wide ranging nature of this project was an exciting opportunity to help develop some of the skills I feel will best suit me to becoming a successful data analyst / sceintist in the future.

## Skills developed in the project ##
- Extensive web scraping to extract raw data:
  - ball by ball data from different seasons / competitions
  - player profile information: "role", batting style, bowling style, overseas status
  - match information: venue, result, teams, dates, scores 
- MySQL instance hosted on Amazon AWS storing raw data
- "Context scaling": devising metrics to assess performance within the match situation, rather than simple stats generation
- Git maintenance: branch hygiene, collaborative coding work
- Python library development: building a library to make some of repeatable work part of a centralised library
  - pandas
  - numpy
- Data Visualisation: designing and producing clean and informative graphs from the analysis we carried out
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
